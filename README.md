Perfect 👍 I’ll give you a **full GitHub-ready README.md** that looks professional and detailed, so you can just paste it into your repo.

Here’s the complete **project description**:

# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **SQL-based data analysis** of healthcare patient records.
The dataset is intentionally **messy** with duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats, to simulate **real-world data cleaning and analysis challenges**.

The project demonstrates how to:

* Import raw healthcare data (CSV) into MySQL
* Clean and preprocess messy data for accuracy
* Perform SQL queries to extract meaningful insights
* Solve real-world healthcare business problems

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset is a **synthetic patient dataset** containing hospital admission details.

**Columns in the dataset:**

* `Patient_ID` – Unique patient identifier
* `Name` – Patient name (may contain duplicates/typos)
* `Age` – Patient age (includes missing/invalid entries)
* `Gender` – Male/Female/Other/NULL
* `Diagnosis` – Disease/condition (some missing or inconsistent)
* `Admission_Date` – Date of hospital admission
* `Discharge_Date` – Date of discharge (NULL if ongoing)
* `Doctor_Name` – Treating doctor
* `Bill_Amount` – Hospital billing amount (includes missing/invalid values)

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 🔹 Step 1: Import Data into MySQL

* Created a **staging table** to store raw messy data.
* Used `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` to load CSV file into MySQL.

### 🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning

* Removed rows with missing or invalid `Patient_ID`.
* Handled missing values in `Diagnosis`, `Discharge_Date`, and `Bill_Amount`.
* Removed duplicate `Patient_ID` using `ROW_NUMBER()`.
* Standardized inconsistent values (`Gender`, date formats, etc.).

### 🔹 Step 3: Data Analysis

Performed SQL queries to analyze patient demographics, hospital stays, diagnoses, and billing.

## 📊 Example SQL Queries

### 👨‍⚕️ Patient Demographics

```sql
-- Total number of patients
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_patients
FROM clean_healthcare;

-- Gender distribution
SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM clean_healthcare
GROUP BY Gender;
```

### 🦠 Diagnosis Insights

```sql
-- Most common diagnosis
SELECT Diagnosis, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM clean_healthcare
GROUP BY Diagnosis
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 🏥 Hospital Stay Analysis

```sql
-- Average length of hospital stay
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(Discharge_Date, Admission_Date)) AS avg_stay_days
FROM clean_healthcare
WHERE Discharge_Date IS NOT NULL;

-- Longest hospital stay
SELECT Patient_ID, Name, DATEDIFF(Discharge_Date, Admission_Date) AS stay_days
FROM clean_healthcare
WHERE Discharge_Date IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY stay_days DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 💰 Financial Analysis

```sql
-- Total hospital revenue
SELECT SUM(Bill_Amount) AS total_revenue
FROM clean_healthcare;

-- Top 3 doctors by billing
SELECT Doctor_Name, SUM(Bill_Amount) AS total_billing
FROM clean_healthcare
GROUP BY Doctor_Name
ORDER BY total_billing DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Database**: MySQL
* **Language**: SQL
* **Dataset**: Synthetic healthcare data (CSV)
* **SQL Concepts Used**:

  * Joins (future scope with multiple tables)
  * Aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`)
  * Filtering with `WHERE`, `HAVING`
  * Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`)
  * Date functions (`DATEDIFF`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`)
